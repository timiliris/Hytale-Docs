# Asset Editor Overview

The Asset Editor is Hytale's primary built-in editor for data assets. It provides a graphical interface for modifying Packs without writing any code.

## What is the Asset Editor?

The Asset Editor allows you to:
- Edit game content through a visual interface
- Modify Packs without programming knowledge
- See changes instantly with hot reloading
- Work with various game data types

## Key Features

### Graphical Interface

No coding required - edit assets through intuitive visual controls:
- Form-based editing
- Drop-down selections
- Value sliders
- Visual previews

### Hot Reloading

See your changes instantly in-game:
- Modifications apply immediately
- No need to restart the game
- Rapid iteration and testing
- Real-time feedback

### Pack Modification

Edit Packs directly:
- Modify existing content
- Create new assets
- Override base game content
- Build complete content packs

## Accessing the Asset Editor

The Asset Editor is built directly into Hytale:
1. Launch Hytale
2. Access the editor through the tools menu
3. Select the asset type to edit
4. Begin making modifications

## Supported Asset Types

Currently supported:
- Blocks
- Items
- NPCs (basic)

## Editor Interface

The Asset Editor interface includes:

| Panel | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Asset Browser | Navigate and select assets |
| Properties Panel | Edit asset values |
| Preview | See visual representation |
| Validation | Check for errors |

## Workflow

### Basic Editing Workflow

1. **Open Asset Editor** - Access from Hytale's tools
2. **Select Asset Type** - Choose blocks, items, etc.
3. **Find Asset** - Browse or search for the asset
4. **Edit Properties** - Modify values in the properties panel
5. **Preview** - See changes in the preview
6. **Test** - Hot reload applies changes instantly

### Creating New Assets

1. Select the asset type
2. Click "Create New"
3. Set asset identifier
4. Configure properties
5. Save and test

## Integration with Other Tools

The Asset Editor works alongside other Hytale tools:

- **Blockbench** - Create models, reference them in Asset Editor
- **Creative Mode** - Test edited assets in-game
- **Node Editor** - Complex behaviors (world gen, NPCs)

## Best Practices

1. **Backup your work** - Save copies before major changes
2. **Test frequently** - Use hot reloading to verify changes
3. **Start small** - Make incremental modifications
4. **Reference existing assets** - Learn from base game content
5. **Organize assets** - Keep your Pack well-structured

## Limitations

Current limitations:
- Some asset types not yet editable
- NPC behavior editing incomplete
- World generation editing in development

These features will be expanded over time.
