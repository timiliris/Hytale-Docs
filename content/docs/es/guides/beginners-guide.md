3. **Wooden Axe** - For faster wood gathering

### Building Your First Shelter

Night brings danger! Build a shelter before sunset:

1. **Find a good spot** - Flat ground near resources
2. **Gather materials** - At least 30-40 blocks of wood or dirt
3. **Build walls** - Create a 5x5 enclosed space
4. **Add a roof** - Prevent creatures from dropping in
5. **Place a door** - Essential for entry/exit
6. **Light it up** - Craft torches to prevent spawns inside

**Quick Shelter Tips:**
- Dig into a hillside for the fastest shelter
- Always have a backup plan (pillar up, dig down)
- Mark your shelter location so you can find it again

### Finding Food

Hunger affects health regeneration:

**Easy Food Sources:**
- **Berries** - Found on bushes (eat raw)
- **Apples** - Drop from trees
- **Vegetables** - Found in wild patches
- **Meat** - From animals (cook it first!)

**Cooking:**
1. Craft a campfire or furnace
2. Place raw food inside
3. Wait for it to cook
4. Cooked food restores more hunger

### Managing Stamina

:::warning Critical Mechanic
Stamina management is ESSENTIAL in Hytale. Running out of stamina at the wrong moment can mean death!
:::

**Stamina is consumed by:**
- Sprinting
- Jumping repeatedly
- Dodging
- Special attacks
- Blocking for extended periods

**Stamina Tips:**
- Never empty your bar completely
- Keep a reserve for emergencies
- Stamina regenerates faster when walking or standing still
- Certain foods boost stamina regeneration

## Combat

### Combat Fundamentals

Hytale features a tactical, skill-based combat system:

**Attack Types:**
- **Light Attack** (Left Click) - Fast, low damage, low stamina cost
- **Heavy Attack** (Hold Left Click) - Slow, high damage, moderate stamina
- **Special Attack** (F) - Unique per weapon, high stamina cost

### The Importance of Stamina

In combat, stamina management is crucial:

- **Always keep a reserve** for dodging
- **Don't spam attacks** - pace yourself
- **Back off to regenerate** when low
- **Watch enemy patterns** - attack during their recovery

### Blocking and Dodging

**Blocking (Right Click with shield):**
- Reduces incoming damage
- Drains stamina while held
- Perfect timing creates a parry window

**Dodging (Double-tap direction):**
- Provides brief invincibility
- Costs moderate stamina
- Essential against heavy attacks

### Weapon Types

Each weapon type has unique characteristics:

| Weapon | Speed | Range | Special |
|--------|-------|-------|---------|
| Sword | Medium | Short | Balanced, good for beginners |
| Axe | Slow | Short | High damage, armor breaking |
| Spear | Medium | Long | Reach advantage, thrust attacks |
| Bow | Varies | Long | Ranged damage, requires arrows |
| Staff | Slow | Long | Magic attacks, special abilities |
