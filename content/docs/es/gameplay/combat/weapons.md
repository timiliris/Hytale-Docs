# Weapons

Weapons in Hytale define your combat style. Each type has its own rhythm, combos, and special attacks. There are no rigid character classes - you define your fighting style through your weapon choice.

## Classification

Weapons are divided into three main categories:

- **Melee** - Close-range combat (swords, daggers, maces, battleaxes, spears)
- **Ranged** - Distance combat (bows, crossbows, throwing weapons)
- **Magic** - Staves and spellbooks

## Melee Weapons

### Swords

The quintessential balanced weapon. **S-Tier** for versatility.

- **Hands**: One-handed (allows off-hand items like shields or torches)
- **Speed**: Medium
- **Damage**: Medium (lower than two-handed weapons)
- **Charged Attack**: Lance charge - dash forward with a piercing thrust

Swords are considered one of the best weapon types due to their versatility. Being one-handed, you can equip shields for defense or torches for exploration.

### Daggers

High mobility, high DPS weapon. **S-Tier** for speed and safety.

- **Hands**: Two-handed (dual-wielded)
- **Speed**: Very fast
- **Damage**: Low per hit, high DPS
- **Charged Attack**: Pounce - launches the player forward with a stabbing attack
- **Ultimate**: Rapid single-target melee combo

Daggers offer extremely high mobility and DPS. The combo attacks combined with the pounce create a mobile, fast-paced fighting style. Mithril Daggers are considered the best weapon in early access due to speed, flexibility, and low risk.

:::tip Dagger Playstyle
Use the melee combo and pounce in tandem for maximum effectiveness. The pounce can be used both offensively and to escape danger.

### Maces

Slow but devastating blunt weapons. **A-Tier** for raw damage.

- **Hands**: Two-handed
- **Speed**: Very slow (slowest melee weapon)
- **Damage**: Very high (best one-hit damage)
- **Charged Attack**: Wide swings that hit multiple enemies
- **Special**: Can change attack direction mid-swing

The Mace takes practice to master due to its slow speed. Once learned, it deals massive damage and can hit multiple enemies with its large swings. Note: You cannot bunny-hop while holding the mace.

### Battleaxes / Greataxes

Power weapons with mobility options. **A-Tier** for damage and crowd control.

- **Hands**: Two-handed
- **Speed**: Slow
- **Damage**: High
- **Charged Attack**: Jumping downward slice - closes distance quickly
- **Ultimate**: Whirlwind attack - damages all surrounding enemies

The charge attack lunge can be used for both offense and defense. Wide swings hit multiple enemies at once.

### Spears

Range and versatility. **Work in Progress** - available in Creative Mode.

- **Hands**: Two-handed
- **Speed**: Medium
- **Damage**: Medium
- **Special**: Can be thrown as a ranged weapon
- **Mechanic**: Thrown spears stick into blocks

Spears are unique in functioning as both melee and ranged weapons. They offer the longest melee reach.

## Ranged Weapons

### Bows

Best ranged weapon for accessibility and consistency. **S-Tier** for ranged combat.

- **Hands**: Two-handed
- **Speed**: Requires charging for full damage/range
- **Ammunition**: Arrows (craftable, plentiful)
- **Ultimate** (Shortbow): Fire three arrows simultaneously

Bows are accessible from the start of the game and easy to use. You must charge the bow to deal full damage and increase range, which leaves you vulnerable during the charge.

| Variant | Speed | Range | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|-------|
| Shortbow | Fast charge | Medium | Ultimate: triple arrow shot |
| Longbow | Medium charge | Long | Higher base damage |

### Hand Crossbows

Burst damage with reload downtime. **A-Tier** for burst potential.

- **Hands**: One-handed
- **Speed**: Rapid fire, long reload
- **Ammunition**: Arrows
- **Drawback**: Heavy gravity dropoff, limited range
- **Ultimate**: Single powerful shot

Hand crossbows can load multiple arrows for rapid successive shots. However, they have a long reload animation and must reload every time you switch to this weapon.

:::warning Crossbow Limitations
Heavily affected by gravity (arrow drop), giving less effective range compared to bows. The long reload leaves you vulnerable.
:::

### Throwing Weapons

Spears can be thrown as ranged attacks and will stick into blocks when they land.

## Shields

Defensive off-hand equipment for one-handed weapon users.

- **Function**: Block incoming damage at the cost of stamina
- **Synergy**: Best paired with swords for balanced offense/defense

## Materials and Rarities

### Material Progression

```
Wood → Stone → Copper → Iron → Thorium → Cobalt/Silver → Mithril → Adamantite
```

| Material | Location | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Wood | Everywhere (Zone 1+) | Starting material |
| Stone | Everywhere (Zone 1+) | Basic tools |
| Copper | Zone 1 (Emerald Wilds) | Entry-level metal, found in caves |
| Iron | Howling Sands (Badlands/Desert) | Mid-tier, abundant in desert caves |
| Thorium | Howling Sands (Badlands) | Green ore, found with iron in desert |
| Gold | Howling Sands | Surface of mushroom-shaped rocks |
| Cobalt/Silver | Snow Biome (Zone 3) | Found in caves and mountain surfaces |
| Mithril | Zone 4 (Tundra/Volcano) | Rare, dropped by giant skeleton boss |
| Adamantite | Zone 4 (Cinder Islands) | Found near lava pockets, red fragments |

:::tip Mining Efficiency
The Howling Sands desert is the best mining destination - Thorium and Iron spawn together in the desert cliffs, allowing you to gather both in a single run.

### Rarities

| Rarity | Color | Characteristic |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| Common | White | Base stats |
| Uncommon | Green | Minor bonus |
| Rare | Blue | Significant bonus |
| Epic | Purple | Unique effect |
| Legendary | Orange | Legendary effect + lore |

### Armor Synergy

Currently, the highest armor tier is **Adamantite**, which provides a light attack damage boost. This makes:
- **Daggers** - Benefit from attack speed scaling
- **Maces** - Benefit from high base damage per hit

## Special Weapons

### Trork Weapons

Recovered from Trorks, unique primitive style:

- Trork Staff (magical weapon used by enemies)
- Brutal and primitive design
- Unique visual aesthetic

### Boss Drops

Some weapons come from defeating bosses, such as Mithril gear from the giant skeleton boss in Zone 4.
