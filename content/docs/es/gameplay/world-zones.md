# World Zones of Orbis

Welcome to the complete guide to the world zones of **Orbis**, the vast and diverse world of Hytale. This guide covers everything you need to know about each zone, from the lush forests of Zone 1 to the volcanic hellscapes of Zone 4.

## Introduction to Orbis

Orbis is the name of Hytale's procedurally generated world. It is divided into distinct **thematic zones**, each associated with a specific element and offering unique challenges, creatures, and resources.

### Key Features of Orbis

- **Elemental Themes**: Each zone is tied to an element (Earth, Wind, Water, Fire, with Lightning and Void planned for future zones)
- **Progressive Difficulty**: The game is designed for natural progression from Zone 1 to Zone 4
- **Unique Biomes**: Each zone contains multiple biomes with distinct ecosystems
- **Diverse Creatures**: Both hostile enemies and friendly NPCs populate each region
- **Procedural Generation**: Every world is unique while maintaining thematic consistency

### Zone Progression Overview

## Zone 3 - Borea

**Element**: Water | **Difficulty**: Hard

### Description

Borea (derived from Latin meaning "the north", also known as Boreal Frontier or Whisperfrost Frontier) is a frozen realm of forested valleys, towering snow-capped mountains, and deep ice caves. The bitter cold permeates everything, and survival requires careful preparation. Each zone has an affinity with elemental magic, and Borea embodies water in all its forms - from winding rivers to snow-capped peaks and icy glaciers. Underground, ice, snow and water cover the walls, and lava is far less likely to appear.

### Biomes

- **Tundra**: Flat, frozen plains with sparse vegetation
- **Pine Forests**: One of the few biomes not completely covered in snow
- **Snowy Mountains**: Massive, snow-covered peaks with breathtaking scenery
- **Ice Caves**: Vast underground caverns with unique wildlife and resources

Borea's freezing temperatures can kill unprepared adventurers quickly.
:::

### Description

The Devastated Lands is a nightmarish realm of active volcanoes, rivers of molten lava, and ash-choked skies. This hellish and barren environment was devastated long ago. Scorched stone dominates the land, with lava rivers and lakes covering the surface. The environment itself is hostile, and powerful enemies lurk around every corner. Only the most prepared and skilled players should venture here.

:::

### Zone 5 - Skylands (Placeholder Name)

**Element**: Lightning

The Skylands are floating islands suspended high above Orbis. Based on datamined information and concept art showing lightning above this area:

- Floating landmasses suggesting a fragmented, vertical world generation style
- Lightning-based theme and elemental affinity
- Possibly features aerial traversal and unusual gravity mechanics
- Storm-based environmental hazards

### Zone 6 - Poisonlands (Placeholder Name)

**Element**: Void

Almost nothing is confirmed about this zone:

- Believed to be related to the Void element
- No firm details about surface or underground structure
- Exists within the game's zone framework for future expansion
