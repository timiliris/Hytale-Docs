# Hostile Creatures

Hostile creatures are your main adversaries on Orbis. Learn their patterns to survive. Enemy difficulty scales with zone progression.

## Trorks

Troll-orc hybrid warriors in the Emerald Grove (Zone 1). Described as "Orbis' most dangerous monster-hunters." The name is a portmanteau of "troll" and "orc."

### Classes

Hytale's modular NPC system allows many variations. Each class requires different combat strategies:

| Class | Equipment | Role |
|-------|-----------|------|
| Sentry | Large stone-tipped spears | Guards village boundaries, alerts others |
| Warrior | Heavy armor, runed battle-axes | Main combatants, frontline fighters |
| Hunter | Runed swords | Hunters of animals and players |
| Shaman | Gold-tipped staves | Magic users, religious leaders |
| Chieftain | Superior gear | Leaders, command other Trorks |

### Anti-Trork Tactics

1. **Eliminate Sentries first** - Prevents alerts to the camp
2. **Target Shamans** - Removes magic support
3. **Avoid camps** - Lure individuals away from groups
4. **Analyze before attacking** - Different classes require different strategies

### Loot

Trorks drop faction-specific weapons and armor with unique Trork runes.
