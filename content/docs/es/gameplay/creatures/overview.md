## Creature Mechanics

### Spawning

- **Zone-based** - Each zone has its unique creature roster
- **Biome** - Each biome within a zone has its spawn list
- **Progression** - Enemy difficulty increases in later zones
- **Variant System** - Same creature types appear with different gear/abilities per zone

### AI Behavior

Hytale's creatures have complex, programmable behaviors:

- **Patrol** - Movement within a defined area
- **Hunt** - Pursuit of prey
- **Flee** - Some flee when injured
- **Alert** - Can call allies (e.g., Trork sentries)
- **Territoriality** - Defend their zone
- **Faction Relations** - NPCs interact with each other (Kweebecs vs Trorks)

### Loot

Each creature can drop:

| Loot Type | Examples |
|-----------|----------|
| Materials | Leather, bones, sturdy chitin, dark feathers |
| Food | Meat |
| Equipment | Weapons, armor (faction-specific) |
| Crafting | Zone-specific materials |
