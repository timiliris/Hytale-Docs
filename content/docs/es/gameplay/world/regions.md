# Regions of Orbis

Regions are the new approach to organizing the world of Orbis. They have replaced the older "Zone" system in how the developers design each part of the world. Each region represents a collection of 3-5 biomes with a cohesive theme that ties gameplay, creative direction, and narrative together. Regions are smaller than the old Zones, but there are more of them - this finer degree of control gives every part of the world a stronger sense of identity.

:::info Zones vs Regions
The original 4 Zones (Emerald Grove, Howling Sands, Borea, Devastated Lands) still exist as the major elemental divisions. Regions are sub-divisions within these zones that provide more detailed world design.

## Difficulty Progression

:::info Non-Linear Progression
The original linear progression (Zone 1 to Zone 4) has evolved. The first three zones now carry multiple internal tiers of difficulty, with resources and loot scaling alongside. Instead of a straight line from "easy" to "hard", players can push deeper into a familiar region or branch into another zone at similar power levels.
:::

### Starting Zone Selection

Players can choose to start in:
- **Zone 1 (Emerald Grove)** - Recommended for beginners
- **Zone 2 (Howling Sands)** - For players who prefer desert environments
- **Zone 3 (Borea)** - For players seeking an early cold survival challenge

Zone 4 (Devastated Lands) is not available as a starting zone.

### General Progression

| Zone | Difficulty | Key Challenges |
|------|------------|----------------|
| Zone 1 | Easy | Learn mechanics, Trorks, basic survival |
| Zone 2 | Medium | Heat, dehydration, Scarak hives |
| Zone 3 | Hard | Cold survival, Outlanders, Yetis |
| Zone 4 | Very Hard | Everything - endgame content |
