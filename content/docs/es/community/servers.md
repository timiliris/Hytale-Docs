## How to Choose Your Server

### 1. Ping and Latency

Choose a server geographically close to you for the best experience:
- **< 50ms**: Excellent connection
- **50-100ms**: Good connection
- **100-200ms**: Playable
- **> 200ms**: May experience lag

### 2. Gameplay Type

Consider what you want to do:
- **PvP fans**: Look for survival servers with PvP enabled
- **Builders**: Creative or survival servers with land protection
- **Social players**: Roleplay or community-focused servers
- **Competitive players**: Mini-game servers with rankings

### 3. Community and Moderation

- Check if the server has active moderators
- Read server rules before joining
- Look for Discord communities to gauge activity
- Check player reviews on listing sites

### 4. Installed Mods

- Some servers run vanilla Hytale
- Others have extensive mod packs

## FAQ - Servers

### How do I see a server's ping?

The server browser in the Hytale launcher displays ping information for each server. You can also sort servers by ping to find the closest ones.

### Are mods mandatory?

No! When you join a modded server, required mods are automatically downloaded and installed. When you leave, your client returns to vanilla state. No manual installation needed.

### Can I play with friends on different servers?

Progress is typically server-specific. Your character on Server A is separate from Server B. However, some servers may offer cross-server features in the future.

### How do I report a server?

If a server violates Hytale's terms of service, you can report it through:
- The in-game reporting system
- Hytale's official support channels
- The server listing site where you found it

### Can I run multiple characters?

This depends on the server's rules. Some allow multiple accounts, while others require one character per player.

### What if a server has too many mods?

Large mod packs take longer to download on first join. After the initial download, subsequent joins are faster. Make sure you have enough disk space.
