# Controls

Master Hytale's controls for an optimal experience. If you're coming from Minecraft, the controls will feel familiar, though there are some key differences.

## Movement

| Action | Default Key |
|--------|-------------|
| Forward | W |
| Backward | S |
| Left | A |
| Right | D |
| Jump | Space |
| Sprint | Left Shift (hold) |
| Crouch | Left Ctrl (hold) |
| Walk | Alt (hold) |

:::tip Toggle Mode
For movement-related actions, you can switch between "hold" and "toggle" behavior in **Settings > Controls**. By default, sprint, crouch, and walk are set to HOLD.
:::

## Combat and Actions

| Action | Default Key |
|--------|-------------|
| Primary action (attack) | Left Click |
| Secondary action | Right Click |
| Ability 1 (weapon skill) | Q |
| Interact | F |
| Secondary interact | E |
| Ability slot | R |
| Drop item | G |

:::info Weapon Skill Bar
Your weapon skill bar charges through successful hits. Press Q when full to unleash a special attack. This system rewards aggressive play while punishing mindless button mashing.
:::

## Inventory and Menus

| Action | Default Key |
|--------|-------------|
| Open inventory | Tab |
| Hotbar slots 1-9 | Keys 1-9 |
| Map | M |
| Player list | P |
| Pause menu | Escape |

## Building

| Action | Default Key |
|--------|-------------|
| Place block | Right Click |
| Destroy block | Left Click (hold) |
| Select block | Scroll Wheel |
| Copy block (pick) | Middle Click |

### Builder Tools

Builder tools are Hytale's higher-level editing tools for sculpting terrain, painting blocks, and copying or pasting structures. Many of these are on the numeric keypad, so a full keyboard layout is ideal if you use these heavily.

## Camera

| Action | Default Key |
|--------|-------------|
| Look around | Mouse |
| Toggle first/third person | V |
| Hide HUD (clean view) | F8 |
| Fullscreen | F11 |
| Screenshot | F12 |

:::tip Third Person View
Unlike Minecraft which uses F5, Hytale uses the **V key** to toggle between first-person and third-person views. Note that you're limited to first-person whenever there is a block above your head.
:::

### Camera Settings

You can adjust your camera preferences in **Settings > Gameplay > Camera**:
- **Field of View**: Default is 75 (adjustable from 30 to 120)
- **Shoulder preference**: Choose which shoulder the third-person camera rests on
- **Camera Preference on Spawn**: Set your default view mode

## Customization

All keys can be reconfigured in:

**Escape > Settings > Controls**

- Every control can be remapped to your preference
- If your new key conflicts with an existing binding, Hytale clears the old assignment
- The Controls menu includes an option to reset all keybinds to default

### Controller Support

Controller support is **not currently available** in Hytale's early access release. The developers have listed controller support as a planned feature for a future update.

## Useful Tips

### Combat Tips

- **Stamina management**: Stamina drains during blocking but not attacking. Use this to maintain pressure while managing your stamina effectively
- **Weapon skill**: Build up your skill bar through successful hits, then press Q for a powerful special attack

### Quick Building

- **Quick placement**: Hold right click while moving
- **Block copy**: Middle-click a block to quickly copy it into your hotbar - useful when copying existing structures or working from reference builds
