## Key Game Mechanics

### The Memory System

Hytale features a unique **Memory System** where you document creature encounters to unlock rewards:
- Exploration becomes as valuable as resource gathering
- Log creatures you encounter for permanent benefits
- Access Memories through the Forgotten Temple

:::warning Activate Early!
The Memory System isn't retroactive. You must activate it early, or you'll miss documenting rare creatures you encounter before unlocking the system.
:::

### The Essence Economy

Collect two types of Essence:
- **Essence of Life** - From plants and animals during daylight
- **Essence of Void** - From demonic creatures at night

These resources fuel advanced crafting stations and NPC trades at the Forgotten Temple hub.

### Death Mechanics

Hytale has forgiving death mechanics:
- You lose some items upon death
- Remaining items suffer 10% durability loss
- Your death location appears as a **gravestone marker** on your map
- Item recovery is straightforward

## Early Game Goal: Forgotten Temple Gateway

The **Forgotten Temple Gateway** is your most crucial early-game objective:

1. Open your map (**M** key)
2. Look for the **spiral icon** marking the Forgotten Temple Portal
3. Prepare before going:
   - Copper Weapons
   - A Shield
   - Cooked food
   - Basic armor if possible
4. Travel to the location and descend into the temple
5. Defeat the golem guardian
6. Unlock access to the hub world, trading, and the Memory system

## Transportation: Horses

Unlike other games, riding horses in Hytale is simple:
- Find an adult horse
- Press **F** to mount
- Sprint for faster travel
- Horses usually stay where you leave them
- Build a makeshift stable (dirt/wood enclosure) to keep them secure

## Tips for Getting Started

### Exploration

- Look for **points of interest** on your map
- Smoke columns indicate camps
- Structures often hide treasures and loot

### Combat

- Build up your **weapon skill bar** through successful hits
- Press **Q** when full for a devastating special attack
- Stamina drains during blocking but not attacking
- Learn enemy attack patterns before engaging

### Resources

- Gather everything early on
- World chests contain useful items
- Talk to NPCs for quests and information

## Next Steps

Once you've mastered the basics:

1. Reach the **Forgotten Temple Gateway** and defeat the guardian
2. Upgrade your **Workbench** to unlock more recipes
3. Craft the **Armorer's Workbench** for better equipment
4. Learn **cooking** at the Chef's Stove for buffs
