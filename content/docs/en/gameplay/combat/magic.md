# Magic

Magic in Hytale offers ranged offensive options through staves and spellbooks. The magic system is still being developed, with more features planned for future updates.

## Early Access Status

The full mana system is **not yet implemented** in Hytale Early Access. Despite a mana stat appearing on the character sheet, staves currently use an **Essence charge system** instead of mana. Spellbooks are currently only usable by enemies, not players.

## Current Magic System

### How It Works (Early Access)

In the current build, magic works through **Elemental Essences**:

- **Essence of Fire** - Powers fire-based staves
- **Essence of Ice** - Powers ice-based staves
- Staves store charges of their elemental essence
- No mana bar management currently required

### Crafting Magic Weapons

To craft magical weapons, you need the **Arcanist's Workbench**:

1. Build an Arcanist's Workbench
2. Gather required materials (metals, essences, gems)
3. Craft staves at the workbench

## Staves

Staves are two-handed magical weapons that allow ranged elemental attacks.

### How Staves Work

- **Basic Attack**: Melee swing (like a staff weapon)
- **Charged Attack**: Consumes stamina to launch a magical projectile
- **Essence System**: Uses stored elemental essences for spells

### Available Staves

| Staff | Element | Attack | Notes |
|-------|---------|--------|-------|
| Fire Staff | Fire | Fireball projectile | Requires Essence of Fire |
| Ice Crystal Staff | Ice | Ice spray/projectile | Requires Essence of Ice |
| Flame Crystal Staff | Fire | Enhanced fire attacks | Rare rarity, crafted with Ruby |

### Flame Crystal Staff

A notable staff requiring advanced materials:

- **Rarity**: Rare
- **Crafting Location**: Arcanist's Table
- **Materials**: Silver ingots, Gold ingots, Ruby, large amount of Essence of Fire
- **Effect**: Multiple fire-based attacks, increased magic stats

### Ice Crystal Staff

- **Appearance**: Wood staff tipped with glowing blue crystals, secured with metal straps
- **Attack**: Creates a spray of ice that travels through the ground and pierces from distance

## Spellbooks (Grimoires)

Spellbooks are tomes containing magical knowledge and spells.

### Current Limitation

In the Early Access build, **spellbooks are currently only usable by enemies**, not players. You will encounter enemies using spellbooks against you, but player functionality is planned for future updates.

### Known Grimoire Types

- **Void Grimoire** - Currently acts as decoration/crafting recipe
- **Air Grimoire** - Currently acts as decoration/crafting recipe

These grimoires appear to be consumed as recipes, presumably to unlock the ability to craft spellbook weapons in future updates.

### Enemy Spellbooks

Enemies can use spellbooks to cast magical projectiles at players. Watch for enemies with books - they indicate ranged magical attacks incoming.

## Other Magic Items

### Enemy Magic Weapons

Some enemies use unique magical weapons:

- **Bone Staff** - Used by undead enemies
- **Trork Staff** - Used by Trork shamans

### Craftable Staves by Material

You can craft staves using various metals:

| Metal | Staff Tier |
|-------|------------|
| Copper | Basic |
| Iron | Standard |
| Thorium | Mid-tier |
| Mithril | Advanced |

## Planned Features

Based on the character sheet and game design, future updates may include:

- **Full Mana System** - Mana bar for casting spells
- **Player Spellbooks** - Ability to use grimoires
- **Multiple Magic Schools** - Offensive, defensive, and utility spells
- **Magic Progression** - Leveling up magical abilities

### Possible Spell Types (Speculative)

From game files and design documents, possible future spells include:

- Persistent zones (area effects)
- Projectiles (various elements)
- Shields and buffs
- Debuffs and curses
- Short-range teleportation

## Tips for Using Magic

### Current Best Practices

1. **Craft staves early** - Build an Arcanist's Workbench when possible
2. **Gather essences** - Collect Essence of Fire and Ice for ammunition
3. **Use charged attacks** - The magical projectiles are more powerful than melee
4. **Mix with melee** - Staves can melee attack when out of essence

### Against Magic Enemies

- Watch for spellbook-wielding enemies
- Dodge roll to avoid projectiles
- Close distance quickly - magic users are often vulnerable in melee
