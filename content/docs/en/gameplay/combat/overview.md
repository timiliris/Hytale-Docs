# Combat System

Combat in Hytale is a dynamic, high-mobility system that emphasizes resource management, positioning, and weapon mastery. The game features full action-RPG combat with dodge rolls, combos, and strategic positioning.

## Fundamental Mechanics

### Stamina

**Stamina** is the central resource in combat:

- **Sprint** - Consumes stamina continuously
- **Dodge roll** - Moderate cost, essential for evasion
- **Charged attacks** - Consumes stamina when released
- **Blocking** - Drains stamina while held

:::tip Stamina Management
Never completely empty your bar! If you deplete your stamina, you become sluggish and vulnerable. Keep a reserve for dodging or switch weapons when running low.
:::

### Positioning

Positioning is crucial, especially in PvP:

- **Flank** - Attack from the sides for advantage
- **Height** - Advantage over enemies below
- **Distance** - Each weapon has an optimal range
- **Environment** - Use pillars, tree roots, and obstacles tactically

### Directional Animations

Attacks are telegraphed through clear animations:

- **Wind-up** - The character prepares their strike (telegraph)
- **Direction** - Indicates where the attack will hit
- **Attack window** - Moment to block or dodge
- **Recovery** - Recovery time after the attack, window for counter-attack

## Attack Types

### Light Attack (Basic Combo)

- **Input**: Left click
- **Speed**: Fast
- **Damage**: Low to medium
- **Stamina**: None or minimal

Each weapon has its own combo rhythm and chain length.

### Charged Attack

- **Input**: Hold left click, then release
- **Speed**: Slow charge-up, variable execution
- **Damage**: High
- **Stamina**: Consumed on release
- **Effect**: Unique to each weapon type (lance charge for sword, pounce for dagger, downward slam for battleaxe, etc.)

### Ultimate Ability

- **Input**: Special ability button
- **Damage**: Very high
- **Stamina/Resource**: Significant cost
- **Effect**: Powerful attack unique to each weapon type

Examples:
- **Dagger**: Rapid single-target melee combo
- **Battleaxe**: Whirlwind attack hitting all surrounding enemies
- **Shortbow**: Fire three arrows simultaneously

## Defense

### Blocking

With a shield or melee weapon:

- **Damage reduction** - Absorbs part of the damage
- **Stamina drain** - Blocking drains stamina (not attacking)
- **Counter-attack** - Window after a successful block

### Dodge Roll

Evasive movement with invincibility frames:

- **Direction**: Roll in any direction based on movement input
- **Cost**: Moderate stamina
- **Effect**: Brief invincibility, repositioning

:::tip Dodge Strategy
Against enemies like Trorks or skeletons, observe their telegraphs - they wind up before striking. Use your dodge roll to evade, then punish them during their recovery animation.

## Combat Strategy

### Weapon Synergy

Hytale rewards smart positioning and weapon synergy more than raw stats:

- **Heavy weapons** (Mace, Battleaxe) - Dominate damage but slow
- **Fast weapons** (Daggers) - Shine through mobility and safety
- **Versatile weapons** (Sword) - Balanced, allows off-hand items
- **Ranged weapons** (Bow) - Safe damage from distance

:::tip Pro Strategy
Combining different weapons based on the situation outperforms sticking to just one. Switch weapons when stamina is low or when facing different enemy types.
:::

### Against PvE Enemies

1. **Observe patterns** - Each enemy has tells before attacking
2. **Wait for openings** - Attack during their recovery frames
3. **Use the environment** - Bounce off pillars, slide under attacks, mantle objects
4. **Adapt your equipment** - Match weapons and armor to the challenge

### In PvP

1. **Read your opponent** - Anticipate their actions
2. **Vary your attacks** - Mix light attacks, charged attacks, and movement
3. **Manage stamina** - The player who depletes stamina first is vulnerable
4. **Use charge attacks tactically** - For both offense and defense (repositioning)
