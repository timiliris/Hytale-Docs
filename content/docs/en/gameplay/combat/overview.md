# Combat System

Combat in Hytale is a dynamic system based on resource management, positioning, and weapon mastery.

## Fundamental Mechanics

### Stamina

**Stamina** is the central resource in combat:

- **Sprint** - Consumes stamina
- **Dodge** - Moderate cost
- **Special attacks** - Variable cost depending on weapon
- **Prolonged blocking** - Continuous drain

:::tip Stamina Management
Never completely empty your bar! Always keep a reserve for dodging.

### Positioning

Positioning is crucial, especially in PvP:

- **Flank** - Damage bonus from the sides
- **Back** - Guaranteed critical damage
- **Height** - Advantage over enemies below
- **Distance** - Each weapon has an optimal range

### Directional Animations

Attacks are telegraphed through clear animations:

- **Preparation** - The character winds up their strike
- **Direction** - Indicates where the attack will hit
- **Parry window** - Moment to block or dodge
- **Recovery** - Recovery time after the attack

## Attack Types

### Light Attack

- **Input**: Left click
- **Speed**: Fast
- **Damage**: Low
- **Stamina**: Minimal

### Heavy Attack

- **Input**: Hold left click
- **Speed**: Slow
- **Damage**: High
- **Stamina**: Moderate

### Special Attack

- **Input**: F (default)
- **Speed**: Variable depending on weapon
- **Damage**: Very high
- **Stamina**: Significant cost
- **Effect**: Unique to each weapon type

### Combo

Chain attacks for combos:

```
Light → Light → Light = Basic combo
Light → Light → Heavy = Finisher combo
Light → Dodge → Heavy = Technical combo
```

## Defense

### Blocking

With a shield or certain weapons:

- **Damage reduction** - Absorbs part of the damage
- **Stability** - Resistance to stagger
- **Counter-attack** - Window after a successful block

### Parry

Precise timing for perfect defense:

- **Window**: ~0.3 seconds
- **Reward**: Enemy stagger, opening for counter-attack
- **Risk**: If missed, full damage

### Dodge

Evasive movement:

| Direction | Input | Effect |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Back | Double-tap S | Backstep, distance |
| Lateral | Double-tap A/D | Roll, partial invincibility |
| Forward | Double-tap W + Sprint | Offensive dash |

## Combat Progression

### Weapon Skills

Each weapon type has its own progression:

- **Novice** → **Apprentice** → **Adept** → **Expert** → **Master**

The more you use a weapon, the more you unlock:
- New techniques
- Advanced combos
- Alternative special attacks

### Combat Styles

Develop your style:

- **Berserker** - Powerful attacks, little defense
- **Guardian** - Attack/defense balance
- **Duelist** - Parries and counter-attacks
- **Ranger** - Ranged combat
- **Mage** - Spells and control

## Advanced Tips

### Against Enemies

1. **Observe patterns** - Each enemy has tells
2. **Wait for openings** - Attack after their combos
3. **Use the environment** - Height, obstacles
4. **Adapt your equipment** - Appropriate resistances

### In PvP

1. **Read your opponent** - Anticipate their actions
2. **Vary your attacks** - Don't be predictable
3. **Manage space** - Control the distance
4. **Stay calm** - Panic drains stamina
